# Upgrade Guide for Version 9

> Note: This is a work in progress document, it will be final when version 9 is released.

Please read this guide carefully if you plan to update your app to this release.

We recommend upgrading your application for each major version gradually, e.g. if you plan to update from 7.x to 9.x, then migrate first to 8.x and then to version 9.

### Removal of deprecated packages and components

The following deprecated components are removed in v9:

- [EmotionThemeProvider](#EmotionThemeProvider) has been renamed to [InstUISettingsProvider](#InstUISettingsProvider) and can configure text direction.
- [ApplyTextDirection](#ApplyTextDirection) has been removed, you can use [InstUISettingsProvider](#InstUISettingsProvider) or [TextDirectionContext](#TextDirectionContext) to configure text direction
- [bidirectional](#bidirectional) has been renamed to [textDirectionContextConsumer](#textDirectionContextConsumer), functionality remains the same.
- [ComponentIdentifier](#ComponentIdentifier), [DateTime](#DateTime): These components have been removed because they are not used by InstUI and other Instructure projects. If you need it, just copy & paste their code.
- [elementMatches](#elementMatches) This polyfill is only needed for old, unsupported browsers.
- InstUI-CLI's `create-app`, `create-component` and `create-package` commands: Just follow the instructions in the [usage](#usage) docs. Also, the `template-component`, `template-app` and `template-app` packages have been removed.

### Removal of deprecated legacy reference attributes from components

Some of our components had reference properties to the underlying html elements which were ment to be used internally within the component itself. These properties will now warn about this usage and will be deleted in v9.

If you wish to get access to the html elements please refer [this](https://instructure.design/#accessing-the-dom) page which will explain how to do it with examples.
