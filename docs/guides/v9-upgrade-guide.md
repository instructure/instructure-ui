# Upgrade Guide for Version 9

> Note: This is a work in progress document, it will be final when version 9 is released.

Please read this guide carefully if you plan to update your app to this release.

We recommend upgrading your application for each major version gradually, e.g. if you plan to update from 7.x to 9.x, then migrate first to 8.x and then to version 9.

The tables below show what will be removed and what are they replaced with. We also marked if there are [codemods](#ui-codemods) available.

### Removed packages and scripts

- InstUI-CLI's `create-app`, `create-component` and `create-package` commands: Just follow the instructions in the [usage](#usage) docs.
- The `template-component`, `template-app` and `template-app` packages have been removed.

### Removal of deprecated legacy reference attributes from components

Some of our components had reference properties to the underlying html elements which were meant to be used internally within the component itself. These properties will now warn about this usage and will be deleted in v9.

If you wish to get access to the html elements please refer [this](https://instructure.design/#accessing-the-dom) page which will explain how to do it with examples.
