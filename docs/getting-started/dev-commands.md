## Dev Commands Cheat Sheet

This is a quick developer reference for common Instructure UI repository commands. All should be run from the repository root. Make sure you run `yarn` first, as many of these commands will require you to have `lerna` dependencies installed before they will work.

| Command                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn bootstrap`                          | Clean all node modules and build output, reinstall dependencies, create fresh build including regenerating design tokens and type declaration files.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `yarn dev`                                | Run a local instance of the documentation app in dev mode. Docs will be served at `http://0.0.0.0:8080`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `yarn start`                              | Run a local instance of the documentation app in production mode. The urls where the docs are being served will be included in the output of this command.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `yarn build`                              | Run the build command for all Instructure UI packages. Similar to bootstrap, but without the cleaning steps, installation of dependencies, and without the token and type generation.                                                                                                                                                       |
| `yarn build:watch`                        | Identical to `yarn build` but will watch for changes. Note: this command is rarely necessary to use. If you are running `yarn dev`, the docs app will already be watching for any changes for components.                                                                                                                                   |
| `yarn build --scope <package-name>`       | Identical to `yarn build` but scoped to a single package. For example, to run the command only for the `ui-badge` package, you would do `yarn build --scope @instructure/ui-badge`                                                                                                                                                          |
| `yarn build:watch --scope <package-name>` | Identical to `yarn build:watch` but scoped to a single package. For example, to run the command only for the `ui-badge` package, you would do `yarn build:watch --scope @instructure/ui-badge`                                                                                                                                              |
| `yarn test`                               | Run all Instructure UI tests in production mode. Tests will be run in a headless instance of chrome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `yarn test:watch`                         | Run all Instructure UI tests in dev mode. Tests run this way will actually launch a browser and will also give you the option to debug.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `yarn test --scope <package-name>`        | Identical to `yarn test` but scoped to a single package. For example, to run the command only for the `ui-avatar` package you would do `yarn test --scope @instructure/ui-avatar`                                                                                                                                                           |
| `yarn test:watch --scope <package-name>`  | Identical to `yarn test:watch` but scoped to a single package. For example, to run the command only for the `ui-avatar` package you would do `yarn test:watch --scope @instructure/ui-avatar`                                                                                                                                               |
| `yarn start:examples`                     | Starts a production instance of [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) with all component examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `yarn dev:examples`                       | Starts a dev instance of [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) with all component examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `yarn generate:component`                 | Create an Instructure UI component with all the boilerplate (for styling etc.) taken care of. There are follow up prompts that will allow you to specify if you would like to create the component in an already existing package or create a new package for it.                                                                           |
| `yarn generate:package`                   | Create an Instructure UI package without a component. This is useful if you are creating a utility package that will contain a JavaScript function/class or a script instead of creating a package that will contain a React component. If you are trying to create a package for a React component, use `yarn generate:component` instead. |
