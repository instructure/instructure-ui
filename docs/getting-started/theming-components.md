## Themes

Instructure UI ships with two built-in themes ([canvas theme](#canvas), [high contrast canvas theme](#canvas-high-contrast)). You can choose which theme to use with [InstUISettingsProvider](#InstUISettingsProvider).

You can read about themes in general in [How themes work](/#themes) and how to customize themes or apply different ones to parts of you application in [Using Theme Overrides](/#using-theme-overrides).

If you are interested in how InstUI's theming engine works and/or you want to make your own components that use the themes, read the documentation of the [@instructure/emotion](#emotion) package.
