{"description":"\n# SSR with Next.js\n\nThis document will demonstrate how to achieve Server Side Rendering (SSR) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) using InstUI components.\n\n> This document assumes that you already have a Next.js application in place.\n\n```js\n---\ntype: embed\n---\n<ToggleBlockquote\n  summary=\"Warning!\"\n>\n  <ToggleBlockquote.Paragraph>\n   You should not install the InstUI meta package <code>@instructure/ui</code> since it has components that are not yet Server Side Renderable out of the box.\n  </ToggleBlockquote.Paragraph>\n  <ToggleBlockquote.Paragraph>\n   The <Link href=\"/#CodeEditor\">CodeEditor</Link> component currently relies on browser specific API's, thus it won't work with SSR! (You can still render it with Next.js's <Link target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import#with-no-ssr\">dynamic</Link> feature while making sure not to render it on the server side.)\n  </ToggleBlockquote.Paragraph>\n  <ToggleBlockquote.Paragraph>\n    <i>Solving this limitation would be a breaking change, so we are planning to do this in the next major version of InstUI (v9).</i>\n  </ToggleBlockquote.Paragraph>\n  <ToggleBlockquote.Paragraph>\n  <strong>You should install only the packages you need!</strong>\n  </ToggleBlockquote.Paragraph>\n</ToggleBlockquote>\n```\n\n#### Initial steps\n\n- install InstUI related dependencies:\n\n```sh\n---\ntype: code\n---\nnpm install @instructure/emotion @instructure/ui-react-utils\n```\n\n- in your Next.js application create - if it does not already exist - a file named `_app.js` inside the `pages` directory. This is a special file in Next.js because it allows you to override/control component initialization. Read more about it in the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app).\n\n- then configure the `_app.js` so your component tree is wrapped with an `InstUISettingsProvider`\n- the important step is to call `generateInstanceCounterMap` on every request, so the server side instance tracking and browser side instance tracking stays in sync with each other:\n\n```js\n---\ntype: code\n---\n//pages/_app.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Head from 'next/head';\nimport { InstUISettingsProvider } from \"@instructure/emotion\"\nimport { generateInstanceCounterMap } from '@instructure/ui-react-utils'\n\nexport default function MyApp(props) {\n  const { Component, pageProps } = props;\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Head>\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"initial-scale=1, width=device-width\" />\n      </Head>\n                                               {/* This is the important step */}\n      <InstUISettingsProvider instanceCounterMap={generateInstanceCounterMap()}>\n        <Component {...pageProps} />\n      </InstUISettingsProvider>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThat is it! You should be ready to go!\n\n#### Notes explaining what is going on with the above code\n\nKeeping track of instances is a way we achieve deterministic `id` generation for components. Since components are being rendered on 2 places (server - client), it is crucial to have the same `ids` attached to the same instances on both the client and server sides.\n\nTo achieve deterministic `id` generation InstUI will keep track of every component instance internally, and will use this information to generate `ids` deterministically.\n","title":"Server side rendering (SSR)","category":"Guides","order":1,"relativePath":"docs/guides/server-side-rendering.md","extension":".md","srcPath":"docs/guides/server-side-rendering.md","srcUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/guides/server-side-rendering.md","packageName":"@instructure/docs","requirePath":"@instructure/docs/guides/server-side-rendering","requireStr":"require('/home/runner/work/instructure-ui/instructure-ui/docs/guides/server-side-rendering.md').default","esPath":"@instructure/docs/guides/server-side-rendering","themePath":"docs/guides/server-side-rendering.md","themeUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/guides/server-side-rendering.md","id":"server-side-rendering"}
