{"description":"\n## Colors\n\nColors are divided into two main technical groups: primitive and semantic colors. Primitive colors store the pure hex values. The primitive colors are the building blocks of the semantic colors. Examples of semantic colors: ui, contrasts, dataVisualization.\n\n### Primitives\n\nThese are here for reference only, usually not needed for InstUI development. Available from the themes and from `@instructure/ui-themes`\n\n```jsx\n---\ntype: example\n---\n<ThemeColors colors={canvas.colors.primitives} label=\"\"></ThemeColors>\n```\n\n### Additional Primitives\n\nThese are here for reference only, usually not needed for InstUI development. Available from `@instructure/ui-themes`\n\n```jsx\n---\ntype: example\n---\n<ThemeColors colors={additionalPrimitives} label=\"\"></ThemeColors>\n```\n\n### Data visualization\n\nThe color names show their hue value and their contrast value on a white background. They don't tell how to use them or for what data they can be applied to. Each hue has 4 primary and 5 secondary colors.\n\n- The data visualization color palette is for data representation only. Like graphs, chars and plots.\n- These are solid colors and can not be used for creating gradients.\n- First you have to use all 4 of the primary colors of a hue, then you can use the 5 secondary ones.\n- Use them on a white background\n\nAvailable from `@instructure/ui-themes`\n\n```jsx\n---\ntype: example\n---\n<ColorTable colors={dataVisualization} colorNames={additionalPrimitives}></ColorTable>\n```\n","title":"Color System","category":"Guides","order":5,"relativePath":"docs/guides/color-system.md","extension":".md","srcPath":"docs/guides/color-system.md","srcUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/guides/color-system.md","packageName":"@instructure/docs","requirePath":"@instructure/docs/guides/color-system","requireStr":"require('/home/runner/work/instructure-ui/instructure-ui/docs/guides/color-system.md').default","esPath":"@instructure/docs/guides/color-system","themePath":"docs/guides/color-system.md","themeUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/guides/color-system.md","id":"color-system"}
