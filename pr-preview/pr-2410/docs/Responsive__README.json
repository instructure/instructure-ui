{"description":"\nThe `Responsive` component allows for rendering a component differently based on either\nthe element or the viewport size.\n\n> **A note on performance**: Try to limit children to only content or components that need explicit updates at different breakpoints. Content that can scale on its own does not need to be rendered via Responsive. Similarly, don't overuse Responsive. Using many Responsive instances on a single page can also negatively affect rendering performance.\n\n### Passing props at breakpoints\n\nBreakpoints are defined by the `query` prop. Different props can be\nspecified for each breakpoint using the `props` prop. These props are passed to the\nunderlying component via the `Responsive` `render` or `children` props as functions.\n\nThe following example using `Avatar` renders as a circle when the element is under 30rem.\n\n```js\n---\ntype: example\n---\n<Responsive\n  query={{ small: { maxWidth: '30rem' }, large: { minWidth: '30rem' }}}\n  props={{\n    small: { shape: 'circle', size: 'medium' },\n    large: { shape: 'rectangle', size: 'x-large' }\n  }}\n  render={(props, matches) => {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <Avatar\n          {...props}\n          name=\"Kyle Montgomery\"\n          src={avatarSquare}\n        />\n      </div>\n    )\n  }}\n/>\n```\n\n### Rendering conditionally based on breakpoint matches\n\nThe `render` and `children` props also receive an array of names corresponding to the\ncurrently matching queries. These can be used to determine what should be rendered at a\ngiven breakpoint.\n\n```js\n---\ntype: example\n---\n<Responsive\n  match=\"media\"\n  query={{\n    small: { maxWidth: 600 },\n    medium: { minWidth: 600 },\n    large: { minWidth: 800}\n  }}\n>\n  {(props, matches) => {\n    if (matches.includes('large')) {\n      return (\n        <Billboard\n          message=\"Large breakpoint\"\n          hero={<IconUserLine />}\n        />\n      )\n    } else if (matches.includes('medium') && !matches.includes('large')) {\n      return (\n        <Byline description=\"Medium breakpoint\">\n          <Avatar name=\"Alexander Hamilton\" />\n        </Byline>\n      )\n    } else {\n      return (\n        <Pill color=\"primary\">\n          Small breakpoint\n        </Pill>\n      )\n    }\n  }}\n</Responsive>\n```\n\n### Defining multiple breakpoints\n\nSetting up multiple media query breakpoints is supported. You can use 4 breakpoints at the same time: `minWidth`, `maxWidth`, `minHeight`,\n`maxHeight`. In the following example, the use of two breakpoints, the `minWidth` and `maxWidth`, are used to render the component with the `medium` label.\n\n**Note:** Overlapping breakpoints for height are not fully supported.\n\n```js\n---\ntype: example\n---\n<Responsive\n  match=\"media\"\n  query={{\n    small: { maxWidth: 400 },\n    medium: { minWidth: 401, maxWidth: 599 },\n    large: { minWidth: 600}\n  }}\n>\n  {(props, matches) => {\n    if (matches.includes('large')) {\n      return (\n        <Billboard\n          message=\"Large breakpoint\"\n          hero={<IconUserLine />}\n          style={{ border: '10px solid #aaa' }}\n        />\n      )\n    } else if (matches.includes('medium') && !matches.includes('large')) {\n      return (\n        <Byline description=\"Medium breakpoint\">\n          <Avatar name=\"Alexander Hamilton\" />\n        </Byline>\n      )\n    } else {\n      return (\n        <Pill color=\"primary\">\n          Small breakpoint\n        </Pill>\n      )\n    }\n  }}\n</Responsive>\n```\n","describes":"Responsive","relativePath":"packages/ui-responsive/src/Responsive/README.md","extension":".md","srcPath":"packages/ui-responsive/src/Responsive/README.md","srcUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/packages/ui-responsive/src/Responsive/README.md","packageName":"@instructure/ui-responsive","requirePath":"@instructure/ui-responsive/lib/Responsive/README","requireStr":"require('/home/runner/work/instructure-ui/instructure-ui/packages/ui-responsive/src/Responsive/README.md').default","esPath":"@instructure/ui-responsive/es/Responsive/README","themePath":"packages/ui-responsive/src/Responsive/README.md","themeUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/packages/ui-responsive/src/Responsive/README.md","id":"Responsive__README","title":"Responsive__README"}
