{"description":"\nThis component is made to display specific AI related data in Instructure products.\n\nThis component is composed from\n\n- `NutritionFacts`\n- `DataPermissionLevels`\n\nIt copies their API exactly, with their name as prefix (e.g.: dataPermissionLevels' `title` becomes `dataPermissionLevelsTitle`). This leads to some redundancy of the data, but makes it easier to use the component.\n\n```js\n---\ntype: example\nreadonly: true\n---\n<div>\n <AiInformation\n  trigger={<Button>AI information</Button>}\n  title=\"Features\"\n  data={[\n    {\n      featureName: \"Feature name\",\n      privacyNoticeText: \"AI Privacy Notice\",\n      privacyNoticeUrl: \"https://www.instructure.com/policies/artificial-intelligence-privacy\",\n      permissionLevelText: \"Permission Level\",\n      permissionLevel: \"Level 1\",\n      description: \"We leverage anonymized aggregate data for detailed analytics to inform model development and product improvements.
