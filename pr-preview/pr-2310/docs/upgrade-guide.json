We are still keeping some Instructure-specific icons, like product logos. We have a codemod that will help you migrate your code to the new icon set (see below).\n\n### Lucide Icons Package\n\nInstUI v12 introduces a new icon package **`@instructure/ui-icons-lucide`** based on the [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/icons/) icon library, providing 1,700+ icons with improved theming and RTL support. The new Lucide icons are wrapped with `wrapLucideIcon` to integrate with InstUI's theming system while maintaining access to all native Lucide props.\n\n**Key differences from `SVGIcon`/`InlineSVG`:**\n\n| Property        | Old API (SVGIcon)                                                                               | New API (Lucide)                                                                                      |\n| :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **size**        | `'x-small'` \\| `'small'` \\| `'medium'` \\| `'large'` \\| `'x-large'`                              | `'xs'` \\| `'sm'` \\| `'md'` \\| `'lg'` \\| `'xl'` \\| `'2xl'` \\| `number` (pixels)                        |\n| **color**       | Limited tokens: `'primary'` \\| `'secondary'` \\| `'success'` \\| `'error'` \\| `'warning'` \\| etc. | 60+ theme tokens (`'baseColor'`, `'successColor'`, `'actionPrimaryBaseColor'`, etc.) or any CSS color |\n| **strokeWidth** | ❌ Not available                                                                                | `'xs'` \\| `'sm'` \\| `'md'` \\| `'lg'` \\| `'xl'` \\| `'2xl'` \\| `number` \\| `string`                     |\n| **children**    | `React.ReactNode`                                                                               | ❌ Removed                                                                                            |\n| **focusable**   | `boolean`                                                                                       | ❌ Removed                                                                                            |\n| **description** | `string` (combined with title)                                                                  | ❌ Removed (use `title` only)                                                                         |\n| **src**         | `string`                                                                                        | ❌ Removed                                                                                            |\n\nThe new icons automatically sync with theme changes, support all InstUI color tokens, and provide better TypeScript integration. All standard HTML and SVG attributes can be passed directly to Lucide icons and will be spread onto the nested SVG element. Existing `@instructure/ui-icons` package remains available for legacy Instructure-specific icons.\n\n## Removal of deprecated props/components/APIs\n\n### Text\n\n- `alert` color has been removed. Please use `primary` instead.\n- Some prop values have been deprecated, see [Text](/Text) for more details.\n\n## API Changes\n\n### Focus rings\n\nFocus rings are now styled in a central pseudo-component called `SharedTokens`. You can override here how it looks, for example:\n\n```js\n---\ntype: example\n---\n<InstUISettingsProvider\n  theme={{\n  themeOverrides: {\n    canvas: {\n      componentOverrides: {\n        SharedTokens: {\n          focusOutline: {\n            infoColor: 'red',\n            offset: '2rem'\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}}>\n  <TextInput renderLabel=\"Name\" placeholder=\"Doe, John Doe\"/>\n</InstUISettingsProvider>\n```\n### Breadcrumb\n\n#### New tokens \n\n- gapSm - Gap spacing for small size breadcrumbs\n- gapMd - Gap spacing for medium size breadcrumbs\n- gapLg - Gap spacing for large size breadcrumbs\n\n#### Theme variable changes\n\n- theme variable `fontFamily` is now removed (handled in link component)\n- theme variable `separatorColor` is now removed (handled in link component)\n- theme variable `smallSeparatorFontSize` is now removed (handled in link component)\n- theme variable `smallFontSize` is now removed (handled in link component)\n- theme variable `mediumSeparatorFontSize` is now removed (handled in link component)\n- theme variable `mediumFontSize` is now removed (handled in link component)\n- theme variable `largeSeparatorFontSize` is now removed (handled in link component)\n- theme variable `largeFontSize` is now removed (handled in link component)\n\n### RadioInput\n\n- Setting `readonly` does not set the low level `<input>` to disabled, but to `readonly`. This also means that the input is still focusable when `readonly`\n- its DOM structure has been significantly simplified\n\n### Spinner\n\n- `as` prop has been removed, `Spinner` will always render as

Pay close attention to its output, it cannot refactor complex code! The codemod scripts can be run via the following commands:\n\n```sh\n---\ntype: code\n---\nnpm install @instructure/ui-codemods@12\nnpx jscodeshift@17.3.0 -t node_modules/@instructure/ui-codemods/lib/instUIv12Codemods.ts <path> --usePrettier=false\n```\n\nwhere `<path>` is the path to the directory (and its subdirectories) to be transformed.\n\nThe codemods that will do the following:\n\n- TODO add details\n- TODO\n\nOptions for the codemod:\n\n- `filename`: if specified then emitted warnings are written to this file.\n- `usePrettier`: if `true` the transformed code will be run through Prettier. You can customize this through a [Prettier\n  config file](https://prettier.io/docs/configuration.html)\n","title":"Upgrade Guide for Version 12","category":"Guides","order":1,"relativePath":"docs/guides/upgrade-guide.md","extension":".md","srcPath":"docs/guides/upgrade-guide.md","srcUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/guides/upgrade-guide.md","packageName":"@instructure/docs","requirePath":"@instructure/docs/guides/upgrade-guide","requireStr":"require('/home/runner/work/instructure-ui/instructure-ui/docs/guides/upgrade-guide.md').default","esPath":"@instructure/docs/guides/upgrade-guide","themePath":"docs/guides/upgrade-guide.md","themeUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/guides/upgrade-guide.md","id":"upgrade-guide"}
