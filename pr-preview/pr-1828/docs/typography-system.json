{"description":"\n# Typography\n\nFor the time being, we have two typography systems working side-by-side. The previous one has remained for backward compatibility reasons and to support possible edge-cases.\n\n## Approach to typography\n\nYour every text-based need should be covered by one of our two, typography components, namely `<Text>` and `<Heading>`.\nThese components have a `variant` prop with a handful of semantic values to choose from. These values describe multiple aspects of the text, such as `font-weight`, `font-size`, `line-height` or even the `html` tag is should render, such as `h1-h5`.\n\nWhile you can set all these properties separately as well, our strong recommendation is to use the variant with semantic values and only deviate from it in cases absolutely necessary.\n\n## <Text>\n\nHere is the list of semantic variant values and what they do in `<Text>`\n\n| variant            | fontStyle | weight          | size               | lineHeight    |\n| ------------------ | --------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |\n| descriptionPage    | normal    | weightRegular   | descriptionPage    | lineHeight150 |\n| descriptionSection | normal    | weightRegular   | descriptionSection | lineHeight150 |\n| content            | normal    | weightRegular   | content            | lineHeight150 |\n| contentImportant   | normal    | weightImportant | content            | lineHeight150 |\n| contentQuote       | normal    | weightRegular   | content            | lineHeight150 |\n| contentSmall       | normal    | weightRegular   | contentSmall       | lineHeight150 |\n| legend             | normal    | weightRegular   | legend             | lineHeight150 |\n\n## <Heading>\n\nHere is the list of semantic variant values and what they do in `<Heading>`\n\n| variant          | level | as  |\n| ---------------- | ----- | --- |\n| titlePageDesktop | h1    | h1  |\n| titlePageMobile  | h1    | h1  |\n| titleSection     | h2    | h2  |\n| titleCardSection | h2    | h2  |\n| titleModule      | h3    | h3  |\n| titleCardLarge   | h4    | h4  |\n| titleCardRegular | h4    | h4  |\n| titleCardMini    | h4    | h4  |\n| label            | h5    | h5  |\n| labelInline      | h5    | h5  |\n","title":"Typography","category":"Guides","order":8,"relativePath":"docs/guides/typography-system.md","extension":".md","srcPath":"docs/guides/typography-system.md","srcUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/guides/typography-system.md","packageName":"@instructure/docs","requirePath":"@instructure/docs/guides/typography-system","requireStr":"require('/home/runner/work/instructure-ui/instructure-ui/docs/guides/typography-system.md').default","esPath":"@instructure/docs/guides/typography-system","themePath":"docs/guides/typography-system.md","themeUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/guides/typography-system.md","id":"typography-system"}
