{"description":"\n# Typography\n\nInstUI provides various typography tokens on theme and component level as well.\n\n## Typography components\n\nYour every text-based need should be covered by one of our two typography components, namely `<Text>` and `<Heading>`.\nThese components have a `variant` prop with a handful of semantic values to choose from. These values describe multiple aspects of the text, such as `font-weight`, `font-size`, `line-height` and for `<Heading>` the DOM element that should be rendered, (i.e.:`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`).\n\nWhile you can set all these properties separately as well, our strong recommendation is to use the variant with semantic values and only deviate from it in cases absolutely necessary.\n\n## <Text>\n\nHere is the list of semantic variant values and what they do in `<Text>`\n\nThis is always rendered as `<span>`\n\nThe values (e.g.:`weightRegular`) are from the currently used theme's typography sections, for example:\n[Canvas Theme](https://instructure.design/#canvas)\n\n| variant            | fontStyle | weight          | size               | lineHeight    |\n| ------------------ | --------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |\n| descriptionPage    | normal    | weightRegular   | descriptionPage    | lineHeight150 |\n| descriptionSection | normal    | weightRegular   | descriptionSection | lineHeight150 |\n| content            | normal    | weightRegular   | content            | lineHeight150 |\n| contentImportant   | normal    | weightImportant | content            | lineHeight150 |\n| contentQuote       | normal    | weightRegular   | content            | lineHeight150 |\n| contentSmall       | normal    | weightRegular   | contentSmall       | lineHeight150 |\n| legend             | normal    | weightRegular   | legend             | lineHeight150 |\n\n## <Heading>\n\nHere is the list of semantic variant values and how are they rendered in `<Heading>`\n\n| variant          | dom element |\n| ---------------- | ----------- |\n| titlePageDesktop | h1          |\n| titlePageMobile  | h1          |\n| titleSection     | h2          |\n| titleCardSection | h2          |\n| titleModule      | h3          |\n| titleCardLarge   | h4          |\n| titleCardRegular | h4          |\n| titleCardMini    | h4          |\n| label            | h5          |\n| labelInline      | h5          |\n\n## Legacy values\n\nFor compatibility reasons we still provide the legacy typography tokens (xxLarge, medium, etc.) so updating InstUI is easier but these tokens shouldn't be used when creating new screens.\n","title":"Typography","category":"Guides","order":8,"relativePath":"docs/guides/typography-system.md","extension":".md","srcPath":"docs/guides/typography-system.md","srcUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/guides/typography-system.md","packageName":"@instructure/docs","requirePath":"@instructure/docs/guides/typography-system","requireStr":"require('/home/runner/work/instructure-ui/instructure-ui/docs/guides/typography-system.md').default","esPath":"@instructure/docs/guides/typography-system","themePath":"docs/guides/typography-system.md","themeUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/guides/typography-system.md","id":"typography-system"}
