{"description":"\n## babel-plugin-transform-imports\n\nThis will convert any non-default imports that are referencing the package only to reference the full path to the module instead. For example:\n\n```js\n// a named member import:\nimport { Text } from '@instructure/ui-elements'\n\nwould be converted to\n\n// a named import using the full module path:\nimport { Text } from '@instructure/ui-elements/lib/Text'\n\nNote that any default imports you are currently using will not be transformed:\n\n// a default import using the full path (will not be transformed):\nimport Text from '@instructure/ui-elements/lib/Text'\n```\n\nNote that this plugin will fail if the exported name is not the filename! This means that it cannot handle multiple exports from the same file.\n\n[![npm][npm]][npm-url]\n[![MIT License][license-badge]][license]\n[![Code of Conduct][coc-badge]][coc]\n\nA babel plugin made by Instructure Inc.\n\n### Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install @instructure/babel-plugin-transform-imports\n```\n\n[npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@instructure/babel-plugin-transform-imports.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.com/package/@instructure/babel-plugin-transform-imports\n[license-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/l/instructure-ui.svg?style=flat-square\n[license]: https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/blob/master/LICENSE\n[coc-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20of-conduct-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square\n[coc]: https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n","category":"packages","relativePath":"packages/babel-plugin-transform-imports/README.md","extension":".md","srcPath":"packages/babel-plugin-transform-imports/README.md","srcUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-transform-imports/README.md","packageName":"@instructure/babel-plugin-transform-imports","requirePath":"@instructure/babel-plugin-transform-imports/README","requireStr":"require('/home/runner/work/instructure-ui/instructure-ui/packages/babel-plugin-transform-imports/README.md').default","esPath":"@instructure/babel-plugin-transform-imports/README","themePath":"packages/babel-plugin-transform-imports/README.md","themeUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-transform-imports/README.md","id":"babel-plugin-transform-imports","title":"babel-plugin-transform-imports"}
