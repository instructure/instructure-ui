{"description":"\n## Testing\n\n### Running Tests Locally\n\n1. Run `npm run test:watch -- --scope @instructure/[package-name]`.\n1. Edit the tests that were generated for you in `packages/[package-name]/src/components/[ComponentName]/__tests__`.\n1. Watch your tests run in the console.\n\n> For details on how to write component tests, see the [test utilities](#ui-test-utils) documentation.\n\n### Continuous Integration\n\nIn CI, `npm run test` (`npm run ui-test`) is run. This runs the tests headless, without the debugging options enabled.\nThe `npm run test` script also accepts the `--scope` argument if you want to run it for a single package or test file.\n\n### Debugging Tests\n\n1. Run `npm run test:watch -- --scope [package name from its package.json]`. This command should automatically open up the Chrome browser.\n2. In Chrome click the 'Debug' button at the top of the page (you may have to scroll up).\n3. Open the [Developer tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/debug/?hl=en) (`Command + Shift + C`).\n4. Now you can add breakpoints in the test code or the component code to debug issues. (`Command + P` in the 'Sources' tab).\n\n### Test Run Options\n\nOptions that can be run with `npm run test`/`npm run test:watch`:\n\n- `--changed` will run the tests against any package that has changes (since the previous commit, including un-staged changes).\n- `--staged` will run tests against packages that have been staged but not yet committed.\n- `--scope [package name from its package.json (comma delimited)]` will run the tests against a single package.\n- `--path [test file paths (comma delimited)]` will run just the tests in a single test src file.\n- `--browser=Firefox` will run the tests in the Firefox browser.\n- `--browser=Safari` will run the tests in the Safari browser.\n- `--randomize` will run the tests in random order, to help catch interdependent or leaky tests.\n\n### Code Coverage\n\nCode coverage thresholds are configured in `karma.config.js` and code is instrumented\nvia babel config (see [@instructure/ui-babel-preset](#ui-babel-preset)).\nIf coverage numbers go below the configured values, the test run will fail.\nWhen you run `npm run test` (or `npm run test -- --scope [package name]`) a detailed coverage report is generated in the `coverage/` directory.\n","title":"Testing","category":"Testing","order":1,"relativePath":"docs/testing/testing-components.md","extension":".md","srcPath":"docs/testing/testing-components.md","srcUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/testing/testing-components.md","packageName":"@instructure/docs","requirePath":"@instructure/docs/testing/testing-components","requireStr":"require('/home/runner/work/instructure-ui/instructure-ui/docs/testing/testing-components.md').default","esPath":"@instructure/docs/testing/testing-components","themePath":"docs/testing/testing-components.md","themeUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/testing/testing-components.md","id":"testing-components"}
