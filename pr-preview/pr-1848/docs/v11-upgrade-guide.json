{"description":"\n# Upgrade Guide for Version 11 (WIP)\n\n## Removal of deprecated props/components\n\n### Table\n\n[Table](/#Table) is now using `TableContext` to pass down data to its child components, the following props are no longer passed down to their children:\n\n| Component | prop        | Substitute / Notes              |\n| --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------- |\n| `Row`     | `isStacked` | is now stored in `TableContext` |\n| `Body`    | `isStacked` | is now stored in `TableContext` |\n| `Body`    | `hover`     | is now stored in `TableContext` |\n| `Body`    | `headers`   | is now stored in `TableContext` |\n\n### Theming engine changes\n\n| Deprecation                                | What to use instead?                                                                                     |\n| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `canvas.use()`, `canvasHighContrast.use()` | Wrap all your application roots in `<InstUISettingsProvider>`                                            |\n| `variables` field on theme objects         | Use the fields from the object above, e.g. use `canvas.borders` instead of `canvas.variables.borders`    |\n| `@instructure/theme-registry` package      | This added the deprecated functions above. Wrap all your application roots in `<InstUISettingsProvider>` |\n\n## Changes\n\n- `ui-dom-utils`/`getComputedStyle` can now return `undefined`: In previous versions sometimes returned an empty object which could lead to runtime exceptions when one tried to call methods of `CSSStyleDeclaration` on it.\n","title":"Upgrade Guide for Version 11","category":"Guides","order":99,"isWIP":true,"relativePath":"docs/contributor-docs/v11-upgrade-guide.md","extension":".md","srcPath":"docs/contributor-docs/v11-upgrade-guide.md","srcUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/contributor-docs/v11-upgrade-guide.md","packageName":"@instructure/docs","requirePath":"@instructure/docs/contributor-docs/v11-upgrade-guide","requireStr":"require('/home/runner/work/instructure-ui/instructure-ui/docs/contributor-docs/v11-upgrade-guide.md').default","esPath":"@instructure/docs/contributor-docs/v11-upgrade-guide","themePath":"docs/contributor-docs/v11-upgrade-guide.md","themeUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/contributor-docs/v11-upgrade-guide.md","id":"v11-upgrade-guide"}
