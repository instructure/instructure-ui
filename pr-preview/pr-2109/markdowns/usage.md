## Quick Start

The following steps will create a React app that uses Instructure UI. Recommended if you are starting from scratch.

##### Create a new React app, e.g. with [create vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project):

```md
---
type: code
---

npm create vite@latest my-cool-app
```

During the interactive project generation phase, please choose React and either JavaScript or TypeScript as the project language. After you have installed the dependencies by running `npm install`, you can try it by running `npm run dev`.

##### Add InstUI dependencies to your `package.json`

We recommend that you add the `@instructure/ui` meta-package, this contains all of our UI components (substitute the version number with the latest one):

```js
---
type: code
---

{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "@instructure/ui": "^10"
  }
}
```

Run `npm install`, so InstUI is downloaded to your `node_modules` folder and can be used.

##### Try the sample code

Now you are ready to use InstUI, let's try it out. Replace the code in `App.js` with the following:

```js
---
type: code
---
import { Button, InstUISettingsProvider, canvas } from '@instructure/ui'

function App() {
  return (
    <InstUISettingsProvider theme={canvas}>
      <Button>Hello from InstUI!</Button>
    </InstUISettingsProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

What does this code do?

- [InstUISettingsProvider](#InstUISettingsProvider) allows to specify the text direction (default is the direction that the user's browser supplies) and the theme to your application. InstUI components require a theme to work, all components are themeable, and themes control their look and feel. There are 2 built-in themes: [`canvas`](#canvas) and [`canvasHighContrast`](#canvas-high-contrast). The component examples seen throughout the documentation use the [canvas theme](#canvas) by default.
- [Button](#Button) is an Instructure UI button component

Finally, run `npm run dev` to start up a basic development server.

Congrats, you have now a (very) basic app that uses Instructure UI :)

## Integrating With an Existing Project

Just add the `@instructure/ui` dependency as shown above and wrap the part of your app that will use InstUI in `<InstUISettingsProvider>` and start using InstUI components.

## Using InstUI with AI coding agents

InstUI provides a compressed, downloadable collection of all component documentation and user guides in an AI-agent-friendly markdown format.

You can download the archive from the following link:
https://instructure.design/markdowns/documentation.zip

The download includes an INDEX.md file that references all available documentation within the compressed folder.

These files are designed to be used as context for AI coding agents.

Additionally, an llms.txt file is available. This file contains a catalog of links pointing to the online markdown files for InstUI components and guides, which are also accessible to AI agents. It can be found at:
https://instructure.design/llms.txt
