# AiInformation


This component is made to display specific AI related data in Instructure products.

This component is composed from

- `NutritionFacts`
- `DataPermissionLevels`

It copies their API exactly, with their name as prefix (e.g.: dataPermissionLevels' `title` becomes `dataPermissionLevelsTitle`). This leads to some redundancy of the data, but makes it easier to use the component.
