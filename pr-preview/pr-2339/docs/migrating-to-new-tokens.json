{"description":"\n# Token migration\n\nThe new token system consists of auto-generated tokens form design. They can be imported from `ui-themes`.\n\n## Changing tokens only\n\nThe migration strategy with the least amount of effort is only changing tokens. This approach keeps the component as class-based and retains the `View` component.\n\nChanges needed:\n\n- Import token types from `@instructure/ui-themes` instead of `@instructure/shared-types`\n- Update `generateStyle` function to use `NewComponentTypes['ComponentName']` for the theme parameter\n- Replace old theme tokens with new token names from the design system\n- Replace `@withStyleRework` decorator with `@withStyle` and remove `generateComponentTheme`\n- delete `theme.ts`\n\nIf tokens are from a different (usually parent) components, add the `componentID` of that component as second paramater of `@withStyle` and use that name in the `generateStyle` function in `style.ts`: `NewComponentTypes['ParentComponentNameWithTheTokens']`\n\n`generateStyle` accepts a third parameter as well, which are the `sharedTokens`. These provide tokens for shared behaviors such as focus rings, shadows or margins. `'@instructure/emotion'` has various util functions that uses these, such as `calcSpacingFromShorthand` and `calcFocusOutlineStyles`.\n\n## Removing View\n\nFor some components it makes sense to remove the `View` component underneath the component structure. Most of the time, `View` only provides margins, focus rings, or minor visual aid. These can be replicated - in most cases - by the `sharedTokens` and their utils.\n\nIdeally all occurrences of `View` would be eliminated from the codebase.\n\n## Transforming class based components to functional\n\nThe ultimate goal is to migrate all components to functional based ones. Currently it's not a priority and detailed migration guides will be available later. For the time being, `Avatar` or `RadioInput` can be used as starting reference points.\n","title":"Migrating components to new theming system","category":"Contributor Guides","order":1,"relativePath":"docs/contributor-docs/migrating-to-new-tokens.md","extension":".md","srcPath":"docs/contributor-docs/migrating-to-new-tokens.md","srcUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/contributor-docs/migrating-to-new-tokens.md","packageName":"@instructure/docs","requirePath":"@instructure/docs/contributor-docs/migrating-to-new-tokens","requireStr":"require('/home/runner/work/instructure-ui/instructure-ui/docs/contributor-docs/migrating-to-new-tokens.md').default","esPath":"@instructure/docs/contributor-docs/migrating-to-new-tokens","themePath":"docs/contributor-docs/migrating-to-new-tokens.md","themeUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/contributor-docs/migrating-to-new-tokens.md","id":"migrating-to-new-tokens"}
