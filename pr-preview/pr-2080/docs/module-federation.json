{"description":"\n# Module federation\n\nInstUI supports [module federation](https://module-federation.io/) with some caveats. In a host app-guest app scenario, you have 2 choices depending on the version of InstUI you are using:\n\n### InstUI v11 or newer\n\nJust use themes as you would without module federation. Note that theme objects are not shared between instances, you will need to pass overrides manually to guest apps if needed.\n\n### InstUI v10.14 - v10.latest:\n\n- Both apps should use `canvasThemeLocal` or `canvasHighContrastThemeLocal` from the `@instructure/ui-themes` package when using themes. This means that `InstUISettingsProvider`'s theme prop cannot be left unset because it will default to `canvas`.\n- Apps cannot use `canvas.use()`, `canvasHighContrast.use()`, these do not exist in the local themes.\n\n### Host app is using InstUI v10.14 or earlier:\n\n- Guest app needs to use **larger** version than InstUI v10.14\n- Host app needs to import the `canvas`/`canvasHighContrast` theme before loading the guest app\n- Guest app must use `canvasThemeLocal` or `canvasHighContrastThemeLocal`. Guest app's `InstUISettingsProvider`'s `theme` prop cannot be left unset because it will default to `canvas`\n- Guest app cannot use `canvas.use()`, `canvasHighContrast.use()`, these do not exist in the local themes.\n\n> Overrides specified in global themes are not applied to local themes.\n\nYou can check out a sample application on [Github](https://github.com/matyasf/module-federation-instui)\n","title":"Module federation","category":"Guides","order":1,"relativePath":"docs/guides/module-federation.md","extension":".md","srcPath":"docs/guides/module-federation.md","srcUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/guides/module-federation.md","packageName":"@instructure/docs","requirePath":"@instructure/docs/guides/module-federation","requireStr":"require('/home/runner/work/instructure-ui/instructure-ui/docs/guides/module-federation.md').default","esPath":"@instructure/docs/guides/module-federation","themePath":"docs/guides/module-federation.md","themeUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/guides/module-federation.md","id":"module-federation"}
