{"description":"\n# Building Instructure UI\n\nInstructure UI is a mono-repository which means it has multiple packages (almost always a component means an individual package) and they are treated as one whole package when dealing with dependencies and building them.\n\nThe project uses `npm` for managing these packages and also for resolving dependencies, running scripts and managing the whole mono-repository itself.\n\n> **Note**: Windows is only partially supported. One can build the project and documentation apps, running other commands (like testing) fail.\n>\n> Also we're using environment variables through our build pipeline and they are defined differently in Linux/OSX and Windows.\n\n### How to build the project\n\nIn order to build the project one should have [`git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (supported version is defined in the root [package.json](https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/blob/master/package.json#L90)) installed.\n\n1. Download the source code and go into the root directory of instructure-ui:\n\n   ```sh\n   ---\n   type: code\n   ---\n   git clone https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui.git\n   cd instructure-ui\n   ```\n\n2. Install dependencies for packages:\n\n   ```sh\n   ---\n   type: code\n   ---\n   npm install\n   ```\n\n3. Run the bootstrap script:\n\n   ```sh\n   ---\n   type: code\n   ---\n   npm run bootstrap\n   ```\n\n   This script will invoke:\n\n   - the `TypeScript` compiler (tsc) to generate the type definitions for the packages\n   - `babel` to transpile the source code of every package to a version that browsers can understand (supported browsers are defined in [`@instructure/browserslist-config-instui`](https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/blob/master/packages/browserslist-config-instui/index.js) package)\n   - a `clean` script which removes any previous build output\n\nThe output of bootstrap can be found in `lib`, `es` (for non node packages) and `types` directories for each package respectively, where:\n\n- `lib` contains [`commonjs`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html#modules-commonjs-modules) module output\n- `es` contains [`es`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/esm.html#modules-ecmascript-modules) module output\n- `types` contains the TypeScript type definitions\n\nThat is all, if you are interested about the available commands check out our [commands cheat sheet](/#dev-commands).\n\n### How to build the documentation\n\nThis assumes that all of the above mentioned steps are completed, meaning the project dependencies are installed and the project itself is built.\n\nThe documentation application is a simple client side only single page application (SPA) built with `React`. It uses Instructure UI components itself.\n\nIn order to build the static files for the documentation, from the project root run:\n\n```sh\n---\ntype: code\n---\nnpm run build:docs\n```\n\nThis should create the static bundle using `webpack`, the output files can be found in `instructure-ui/packages/__docs__/__build__/`.\n\nWe use this bundle to host the documentation at [instructure.design](https://instructure.design).\n","title":"How to build Instructure UI","category":"Contributor Guides","order":2,"relativePath":"docs/contributor-docs/building-instui.md","extension":".md","srcPath":"docs/contributor-docs/building-instui.md","srcUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/contributor-docs/building-instui.md","packageName":"@instructure/docs","requirePath":"@instructure/docs/contributor-docs/building-instui","requireStr":"require('/home/runner/work/instructure-ui/instructure-ui/docs/contributor-docs/building-instui.md').default","esPath":"@instructure/docs/contributor-docs/building-instui","themePath":"docs/contributor-docs/building-instui.md","themeUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/contributor-docs/building-instui.md","id":"building-instui"}
