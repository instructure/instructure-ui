{"description":"\n# Upgrade Guide for Version 10\n\n## Introduction\n\nInstUI v10 is a major release with a new theming color system. It has been simplified and rewritten to make our design language easier to understand and more uniform.\n\nWith the new system some old designs could be more challenging or very hard to implement. This is intentional, we wanted\nto avoid situations when someone really changes the look and feel of their application.\nIn these cases, make sure you talk with your designer and update the UI according to the new designs.\n\nThe revised designs should result in better accessibility ([WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) compliance!), less theming code and more uniform look and feel.\n\n## Step-by-step guide\n\nWe recommend upgrading your application for each major version gradually, e.g. if you plan to update from 8.x to 10.x,\nthen migrate first to the latest 9.x and then to version 10.\n\nThe places where your code can break during the upgrade are related to theme overrides, color props and color utilities.\nPlease check the [theming components](#theming-components) guide to understand the new color system.\n\nIf you override the theme colors, you must use the new colors provided either in the `canvas-high-contrast` or in the `canvas` theme object.\nThe previous color system has been removed, the old color names are no longer available.\n\n### `Instructure` theme is removed\n\nInstructure theme (`@instructure/instructure-theme`) is no longer maintained and not compatible with InstUI v10.\nIf you were using it, you need to switch to the `canvas` or the `canvas-high-contrast` theme.\n\n### Component level color overrides\n\nIf you had component level overrides of colors you need to migrate using the following table:\n\n| Old                | New (v10)                     |\n| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |\n| `colors.Brand`     | `colors.contrasts.blue4570`   |\n| `colors.Link`      | `colors.contrasts.blue4570`   |\n| `colors.Electric`  | `colors.contrasts.blue4570`   |\n| `colors.Shamrock`  | `colors.contrasts.green4570`  |\n| `colors.Barney`    | `colors.contrasts.blue4570`   |\n| `colors.Crimson`   | `colors.contrasts.red4570`    |\n| `colors.Fire`      | `colors.contrasts.orange4570` |\n| `colors.Licorice`  | `colors.contrasts.grey125125` |\n| `colors.Oxford`    | `colors.contrasts.grey100100` |\n| `colors.Ash`       | `colors.contrasts.grey4570`   |\n| `colors.Slate`     | `colors.contrasts.grey4570`   |\n| `colors.Tiara`     | `colors.contrasts.grey1214`   |\n| `colors.Porcelain` | `colors.contrasts.grey1111`   |\n| `colors.White`     | `colors.contrasts.white1010`  |\n\nYou can use the latest [codemod](#ui-codemods) to automate this process.\n\nInstUI v9:\n\n```jsx\n---\ntype: code\n---\n<Heading level=\"h3\" color=\"primary\"\n         themeOverride={{primaryColor: canvas.colors.brand}}>\n    I have nice color!\n</Heading>\n```\n\nInstUI v10:\n\n```jsx\n---\ntype: code\n---\n<Heading level=\"h3\" margin=\"small small\" color=\"primary\"\n         themeOverride={{primaryColor: canvas.colors.contrasts.blue4570}}>\n    some nice blue text.\n</Heading>\n```\n\nNotice, that the new values use `colors.contrasts`. Please do not use `colors.primitives` for anything.\n\n### Theme level color overrides\n\nInstUI v9 theme level properties `text`, `background`, `border` (for example `backgroundLightest` or `textDarkest`) have been removed.\nTo upgrade these props you need to find and override component level theme variables for each component that used the replaced property.\n**This is heavily discouraged, upcoming designs should not necessitate theme overrides.**\n\nFor example, if you had `backgroundLightest` overridden on the theme level, you need to find every component whose theme\nutilizes `backgroundLightest` and override them individually in each component. Some of these components are `Alert`, `Avatar`, `Billboard`, `View` and many more.\n\nInstUI v9:\n\n```jsx\n---\ntype: code\n---\n\n<InstUISettingsProvider\n  theme={{\n    themeOverrides: {\n      canvas: {\n        colors: { backgroundLightest: 'orange' }\n      }\n    }\n  }}\n>\n```\n\nInstUI v10:\n\n```jsx\n---\ntype: code\n---\n\n<Alert themeOverride={{background: 'orange'}}></Alert>\n<Avatar themeOverride={{background: 'orange'}}></Avatar>\n<Billboard themeOverride={{background: 'orange'}}></Billboard>\n<Tabs themeOverride={{defaultBackground: 'orange', scrollFadeColor:'orange'}}></Tabs>\n//...and all other components that use color.backgroundLightest\n```\n","title":"Upgrade Guide for Version 10.0","category":"Guides","order":98,"relativePath":"docs/contributor-docs/v10-upgrade-guide.md","extension":".md","srcPath":"docs/contributor-docs/v10-upgrade-guide.md","srcUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/contributor-docs/v10-upgrade-guide.md","packageName":"@instructure/docs","requirePath":"@instructure/docs/contributor-docs/v10-upgrade-guide","requireStr":"require('/home/runner/work/instructure-ui/instructure-ui/docs/contributor-docs/v10-upgrade-guide.md').default","esPath":"@instructure/docs/contributor-docs/v10-upgrade-guide","themePath":"docs/contributor-docs/v10-upgrade-guide.md","themeUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/contributor-docs/v10-upgrade-guide.md","id":"v10-upgrade-guide"}
