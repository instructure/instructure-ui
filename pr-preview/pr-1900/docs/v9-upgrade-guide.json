{"description":"\n# Upgrade Guide for Version 9\n\nPlease read this guide carefully if you plan to update your app to this release.\n\nWe recommend upgrading your application for each major version gradually, e.g. if you plan to update from 7.x to 9.x, then migrate first to 8.x and then to version 9.\n\nThe tables below show what is removed and what they are replaced with. We also marked if there are [codemods](#ui-codemods) available.\n\n### CommonJS build has been deprecated in v9\n\nSince CommonJS style imports `require(..)` have been superseded by ES6 style imports `import … from …` and are well supported both in browsers and in node.js we decided to no longer support packages with CommonJS style imports in our releases.\n\nSome of our internal toolings require commonjs still and the refactor takes a long time. We decided to deprecate but leave in the CommonJS build for the time being, but - since it's deprecated - we will remove it without a breaking change notice or major release in the future.\n\n**IMPORTANT!**\\\n**tl;dr: Even so the CommonJS build is still available, please do not use it, it will be removed anytime**\n\n### Deprecated and Removed Components\n\n| Component                 | Substitute / Notes                                                                                                                                              |\n| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [CodeEditor](#CodeEditor) | CodeEditor stays deprecated in v9. Use [SourceCodeEditor](#SourceCodeEditor) instead, which is the wrapper for the newer version of the CodeMirror code editor. |\n| Navigation                | Navigation has been removed in v9. Use the new [SideNavBar](#SideNavBar) instead.                                                                               |\n\n### Removed Utilities\n\n| Utility              | Substitute / Notes                                                                                                                                                        |\n| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| addResizeListener    | Use the native [ResizeObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver) utility. Example usage: [here](#addResizeListener)                       |\n| ApplyTextDirection   | Use [InstUISettingsProvider](#InstUISettingsProvider) instead to configure text direction.                                                                                |\n| bidirectional        | It has been renamed to [textDirectionContextConsumer](#textDirectionContextConsumer), functionality remains the same.                                                     |\n| Browser              | It has been removed in v9.                                                                                                                                                |\n| ComponentIdentifier  | This util has been removed because it is not used by InstUI and other Instructure projects. If you need it, just copy & paste their code.                                 |\n| elementMatches       | This polyfill is only needed for old, unsupported browsers.                                                                                                               |\n| EmotionThemeProvider | It has been renamed to [InstUISettingsProvider](#InstUISettingsProvider) and can now also configure text direction.
