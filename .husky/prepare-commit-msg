# Don't run this hook on --amend or rebase
# From https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli/issues/672#issuecomment-1328123802
#
# Explanation:
# Per the [prepare-commit-msg hook docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_prepare_commit_msg),
# the second argument can have these values:
# - Empty: No message supplied
# - "message": Message was supplied via -m or -F
# - "template": Template was supplied via -t or via commit.template git config
# - "merge": Commit is a merge commit or .git/MERGE_MSG file exists
# - "squash": .git/SQUASH_MSG file exists
# - "commit": -c, -C, or --amend was supplied. In this case, the script gets a third argument representing the commit object.

if [ -z "$2" ]; then
  exec < /dev/tty && npx cz --hook
