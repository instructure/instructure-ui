# This directory uses npm instead of pnpm
#
# The regression-test app is designed to simulate how external consumers
# would use the @instructure/ui package. Since most external users install
# packages via npm, this directory intentionally uses npm to:
# - Test the package as it would be consumed in real-world scenarios
# - Catch potential issues with dependency resolution that differ between npm and pnpm
# - Ensure published packages work correctly with npm's installation behavior
#
# The main monorepo uses pnpm for development, but this app remains npm-only.
