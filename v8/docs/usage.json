{"description":"\n## Quick Start\n\nThe following steps will create a React app that uses Instructure UI. Recommended if you are starting from scratch.\n\n1. Create a new React app, e.g. with [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html):\n\n```md\n---\ntype: code\n---\nnpx create-react-app my-cool-app\n```\n\nThis will generate a vanilla React app with tests, sample code and scripts. You can try it by running `npm start`.\n\n2. Add InstUI dependencies to your `package.json`. We recommend that you add the `@instructure/ui` meta-package, this contains all of our UI components (substitute the version number with the latest one):\n\n```md\n---\ntype: code\n---\n{\n    ...\n    \"dependencies\": {\n        ...\n        \"@instructure/ui\": \"^8\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRun `npm install`, so InstUI is downloaded to your `node_modules` folder and can be used.\n\n3. Now you are ready to use InstUI, let's try it out. Replace the code in `App.js` with the following:\n\n```js\n---\ntype: code\n---\nimport { Button, InstUISettingsProvider, canvas } from '@instructure/ui'\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <InstUISettingsProvider theme={canvas}>\n      <Button>Hello from InstUI!</Button>\n    </InstUISettingsProvider>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App\n```\n\nWhat does this code do?\n\n- [InstUISettingsProvider](#InstUISettingsProvider) allows to specify the text direction (default is the direction that the user's browser supplies) and the theme to your application. InstUI components require a theme to work, all components are themeable, and themes control their look and feel. There are 3 built-in themes: [`canvas`](#canvas), [`canvasHighContrast`](#canvas-high-contrast), [`instructure`](#instructure). The component examples seen throughout the documentation use the [canvas theme](#canvas) by default.\n- [Button](#Button) is an Instructure UI button component\n\nFinally, run `npm start` to start up a basic development server.\n\nCongrats, you have now a (very) basic app that uses Instructure UI :)\n\n## Integrating With an Existing Project\n\nJust add the `@instructure/ui` dependency as shown above and wrap the part of your app that will use InstUI in `<InstUISettingsProvider>` and start using InstUI components.\n\n## Further reading\n\n- To use a different theme or customize one read about [InstUISettingsProvider](#InstUISettingsProvider)\n- Make sure you read about [Accessibility](#accessibility) with InstUI.\n- [How to make your own component that uses InstUI's theming engine](#emotion)\n","title":"Usage","category":"Getting Started","order":1,"relativePath":"docs/getting-started/usage.md","extension":".md","srcPath":"docs/getting-started/usage.md","srcUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/getting-started/usage.md","packageName":"@instructure/docs","requirePath":"@instructure/docs/getting-started/usage","requireStr":"require('/Users/balazs.saros/work/instructure-ui/docs/getting-started/usage.md').default","esPath":"@instructure/docs/getting-started/usage","themePath":"docs/getting-started/usage.md","themeUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/getting-started/usage.md","id":"usage"}
