{"description":"\n## Converting old tests\n\nThis guide explains how to convert current InstUI tests written with the `@instructure/ui-test-utils` testing library to\nuse Jest + React Testing Library.\n\n### Running Jest\n\nJest can be run from the project root with the `npm run test:new` command. It's configured in our CI pipeline so pushing a\nbranch to remote runs these tests together with the legacy tests automatically.\n\n### Adding new tests to a package\n\nCurrent tests can be found next to the component source code in the `__tests__` subfolder. New tests should be added\nthere in the `__new-tests__` directory. New test files should have the same names as the ones in `__tests__`.\n\nNew tests should try to mirror old tests as close as possible, most of the time this will be trivial.\n\n### Skipping old tests\n\nOnce a test is rewritten in the new framework the old counterpart should be skipped to indicate that it's converted and\nalso to be resourceful with our CI. This can be done by adding `.skip` to individual tests or the whole suite. E.g.:\n`it('should...')` -> `it.skip('should...)` or `describe('<Component/>)` -> `describe.skip('<Component/>')`. If a whole\nsuite is skipped there's no need to skip individual tests inside it.\n\n### Example\n\nThe `ui-avatar` tests were added as an example/reference. They can be found [here](https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/packages/ui-avatar/src/Avatar/__new-tests__).\n","title":"Converting old tests","category":"Testing","order":4,"relativePath":"docs/testing/converting-old-tests.md","extension":".md","srcPath":"docs/testing/converting-old-tests.md","srcUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/testing/converting-old-tests.md","packageName":"@instructure/docs","requirePath":"@instructure/docs/testing/converting-old-tests","requireStr":"require('/home/runner/work/instructure-ui/instructure-ui/docs/testing/converting-old-tests.md').default","esPath":"@instructure/docs/testing/converting-old-tests","themePath":"docs/testing/converting-old-tests.md","themeUrl":"https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/tree/master/docs/testing/converting-old-tests.md","id":"converting-old-tests"}
