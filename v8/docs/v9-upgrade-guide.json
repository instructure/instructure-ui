{"description":"\n# Upgrade Guide for Version 9\n\n> Note: This is a work in progress document, it will be final when version 9 is released.\n\nPlease read this guide carefully if you plan to update your app to this release.\n\nWe recommend upgrading your application for each major version gradually, e.g. if you plan to update from 7.x to 9.x, then migrate first to 8.x and then to version 9.\n\nThe tables below show what will be removed and what are they replaced with. We also marked if there are [codemods](#ui-codemods) available.\n\n### CommonJS build has been removed in v9\n\nSince CommonJS style imports `require(..)` have been superseded by ES6 style imports `import … from …` and are well supported both in browsers and in node.js we decided to no longer include packages with CommonJS style imports in our releases.\n\n### Deprecated Components\n\n| Component                 | Substitute / Notes                                                                                                                                              |\n| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [CodeEditor](#CodeEditor) | CodeEditor stays deprecated in v9.
