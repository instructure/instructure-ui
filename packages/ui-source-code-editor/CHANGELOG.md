### Features

- **ui-source-code-editor,ui-code-editor,ui:** add new `SourceCodeEditor` component ([b5064f5](https://github.com/instructure/instructure-ui/commit/b5064f5c767eb2d5c5a6d7f5bb6d05bd689418b5))

##### SourceCodeEditor component

A wrapper around the popular [CodeMirror V6](https://codemirror.net/) code editor component. CodeMirror provides a text input field with features like line gutters, syntax highlighting, and autocompletion.
It has better accessibility features than the (now deprecated) [CodeEditor](/#CodeEditor) component that is based on the former [version 5](https://codemirror.net/5/index.html) of CodeMirror.
