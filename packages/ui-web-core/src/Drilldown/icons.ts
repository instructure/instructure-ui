 * POC icon set for the Lit Drilldown. Path data hand-copied from Lucide
 * (lucide-react, ISC license) to match the React Drilldown's icons:
 *
 *   check        → CheckInstUIIcon        = lucide-react/check
 *   chevronLeft  → ChevronLeftInstUIIcon  = lucide-react/chevron-left
 *   chevronRight → ChevronRightInstUIIcon = lucide-react/chevron-right
 *
 * When `@instructure/ui-icons-svg` lands on this branch, these inline SVGs
 * should be replaced by imports from that package so the source-of-truth
 * lives in one place.
