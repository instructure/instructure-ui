/**
 * ---
 * category: utilities/i18n
 * ---
 * A decorator or higher order component that makes a component `bidirectional`.
 *
 * As a HOC:
 *
 * ```js
 * import { bidirectional } from '@instructure/ui-i18n'
 *
 * class Example extends React.Component {
 *   render () {
 *     return this.dir === bidirectional.DIRECTION.rtl ? <div>rtl</div> : <div>ltr</div>
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * export default bidirectional()(Example)
 * ```
 *
 * When used as a child of [ApplyTextDirection](#ApplyTextDirection), bidirectional components use
 * the direction provided in the context. When used without [ApplyTextDirection](#ApplyTextDirection),
 * the direction can be supplied explicitly via the `dir` prop. If no `dir` prop is provided,
 * bidirectional components query the documentElement for the `dir` attribute, defaulting to `ltr`
 * if it is not present.
 *
 * @return {function} composes the bidirectional component.
