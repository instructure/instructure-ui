describes: PresentationContent
---

A component that _tries_ to hide itself from screen readers, absolutely
expecting that you're providing a more accessible version of the resource
using something like a ScreenReaderContent component.

Be warned that this does not totally prevent all screen readers from
seeing this content in all modes. For example, VoiceOver in OS X will
still see this element when running in the "Say-All" mode and read it
along with the accessible version you're providing.

Use of this component is discouraged unless there's no alternative
(e.g. for data visualizations)

```js
---
type: example
---
<PresentationContent>
  <Text>
    Presentational content here
  </Text>
</PresentationContent>
```
