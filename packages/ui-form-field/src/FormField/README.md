describes: FormField

This is a helper component that is used by most of the custom form
components. In most cases it shouldn't be used directly.

```js

type: example
---
<FormField id="_foo123" label="Opacity" width="200px">
  <input style={{display: 'block', width: '100%'}} id="_foo123"/>
</FormField>
```
