## ui-testable

A decorator that adds a `data-` attribute to the React component root node
to make it easier to test.

**NOTE: by default, when NODE_ENV==='production' the `data-` attributes will not be appended**
(since they are specifically there for testing and appending them takes a non-trivial
amount of time at runtime, slowing things down for your actual users).
If you would like the `data-cid` attributes on elements even in your production
builds (like if you are using them in your e2e builds or something),
you need to set the environment variable:

```sh
ALWAYS_APPEND_UI_TESTABLE_LOCATORS=1
```

### Installation

```sh
yarn add @instructure/ui-testable
```
